My name is Sean. This is just a place for me to document the things I learn along my professional journey.

I’ve been a Support Engineer at VMware for nearly 5 years. Before that I worked supporting DevOps and R&D teams within HP. A constant throughout my roles has been "how can we take more of what we do and automate it?".

This question has given me the chance to work with Python, Javascript, Bash, PowerShell, Ansible and some more I'm forgetting by now. Most recently I've been supporting environments using [vRealize Automation](https://www.vmware.com/products/vrealize-automation.html) & [vRealize Orchestrator](https://www.vmware.com/products/vrealize-orchestrator.html). Being in a position to see what so many people are getting to do across public and private clouds I've decided to start documenting my efforts to build and sustain an environment of my own.

Using some hardware I have around the house and the various free offerings of public clouds I want to see how large and effective of a lab I can build for as little money as possible.
